This project implements a Human Activity Recognition System using Object Detection and Recognition techniques. By integrating advanced deep learning architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), the system processes video data to identify and classify human activities.

The system is designed for applications in surveillance, healthcare, and sports analytics, where accurate and efficient activity recognition is crucial.
